# Stork

System for automated data and pipeline migration. Stork automates the process of data and pipeline migration to database and cloud environments.
Stork migrates the data and project in three steps:
1. Pipeline Analysis
2. Data Transfer
3. Pipeline Rewrite

### Static Code Analysis 

Through parsing the AST of each pipeline in a given repository, Stork generates essential metadata regarding the location and format of the data. Next, Stork formats and migrates the data to a new destination in a hosted Database Management System or a cloud storage service. 

## Setup [TODO]


## Using the system [TODO]
